            Coding is not just for the chosen few.  Anyone can learn with the right environment, resources and dedication - we created Code Academy to do just that. We teach aspiring developers and entrepreneurs how to build their own web applications with Ruby on Rails.
          %p
            "Most" people read books, tutorials, do workshops, and spend lots of time (and $$$) without the necessary resources, motivation and environment to make sure what they learn sticks.  Code Academy takes those missing elements and makes them the priority.
          %p
            We are beginner-focused, collaborative, and intensive.  We provide you with everything necessary for coding: computers, software, and an environment (link to space) that makes learning and productivity unavoidable. You'll learn more in 12 weeks than most do in a year.

With Code Academy, you will no longer be just an admirer of what code produces.  There’s no greater thrill than being able to take all the ideas you’ve had in the back of your head and turn them into something tangible and real.
            %h3 It's rewarding.
            %p Code Academy is an unprecedented opportunity. It gives you the chance to interact with the best in the Chicago entrepreneurial and tech communities, and opens doors to networks you would not have encountered otherwise.
