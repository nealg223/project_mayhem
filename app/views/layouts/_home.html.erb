      <p>I've known entrepreneurs who've taken books and taught 
      themselves programming in their basement. And have built businesses a couple 
      years later. If they could've had an academy to speed that up, it would've 
      been an invaluable service. -Bill Pescatello,  <strong>Lightbank.com</strong></p>
